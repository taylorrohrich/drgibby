          To all my patients,
        </p>
        <p>
          Serving my patients over the past 35 years has been my utmost pleasure. Although it is difficult, I
          am pleased to announce my retirement as of January 31st, 2023, and the culmination of my solo
          practice at The Women's Center for Cosmetic and Plastic Surgery.

          Established patients may contact me at <a href="mailto: drgibby@drgibby.com">drgibby@drgibby.com</a>

          patients may contact me at the above email with a description of the procedure they are interested
          in, and I will give an appropriate referral.
        </p>
        <p>
          It has been an enormously gratifying experience to provide care to so many wonderful patients over
          the past three decades. Thank you for being a part of an immensely satisfying career in the practice
          of cosmetic surgery. It has been a great pleasure meeting and caring for you all. I sincerely
          appreciate your friendship and loyalty. I wish you continued good health and all the best in the
